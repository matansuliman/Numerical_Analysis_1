# Numerical Analysis 1
## Chapter 2 - Solutions to One-Variable Equations
### List of Scripts:
* aitkens.py: Implements Aitken's method for accelerating the convergence of a sequence.
* bisection.py: Implements the bisection method, a simple yet robust numerical method for finding roots of real-valued functions.
* false_position.py: Implements the false position (or regula falsi) method, an iterative root-finding algorithm that efficiently narrows down the interval containing the root.
* fixedPoint.py: Implements the fixed-point iteration method, useful for finding fixed points of functions.
* newton_method.py: Implements Newton's method (Newton-Raphson method), a powerful root-finding algorithm based on linear approximation and iterative refinement.
* secant_method.py: Implements the secant method, a root-finding algorithm similar to Newton's method but doesn't require the calculation of derivatives, making it suitable for functions with complex or non-differentiable behavior.
* steffensens.py: Implements Steffensen's method, which accelerates the convergence of sequences, particularly useful for functions with slow convergence rates.

### Usage:
Each script can be executed independently by running the corresponding Python file. They typically take the function to be solved, initial guesses or intervals, and any additional parameters specific to the method being used. The output usually includes the solution(s) found and possibly convergence information.

### Dependencies:
These scripts require Python 3.x and standard libraries. No additional dependencies are needed.
